# Profile-page
This page consists of a profile of an individual which has a logo and a reference to download the pdf of the profile.

The page uses CSS styling. For the header, a background image is used and its opacity is controlled so it is kind of soothing to eyes. the header section consists of two buttons, 1.Download: To download the pdf version of this profile, 2.Hire Me: Contains detailed information that is required for the hiring team to know about me.

In the main section, flex-box and pseudo classes are used. Flex-box is used to align the image and the content side-by-side whereas, pseudo classes are used on alternate sections to swap the position of image and its content.

Footer section has reference to my social media accounts and copyright information. Also the page is made responsive using media queries.

Given below is the live link of the profile page.
